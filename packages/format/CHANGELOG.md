### Minor Changes

- cf39429: Introduce `@gram-lang/format`, a standalone canonical code formatting engine for `.gram` files with 13 deterministic rules, used by the CLI and Language Server.
- 99aa179: Fixed two bugs in the recipe formatter:

  - A `#cookware` reference at the very start of a line (e.g. `#pan(20cm)`) was incorrectly treated as a malformed section header and got a space inserted after the `#`, turning it into plain text and silently breaking the recipe.
  - Blank-line spacing before a `## Section` header was being promoted to two blank lines instead of Gram's actual convention of exactly one blank line between every step and/or section. The formatter now consistently enforces a single blank line everywhere, including before section headers. As a result, the `sectionSpacing` counter (previously reported alongside `consecutiveBlankLines`) has been removed — this kind of spacing fix is now reported as part of `consecutiveBlankLines`.
