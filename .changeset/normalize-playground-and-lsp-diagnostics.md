**Language Server & Tooling**: Normalized error states and unified diagnostic handling across Playground and VSCode extensions:
  - Unified Playground diagnostics into a centralized full-width debug console with filter pills and interactive jump-to-location navigation.
  - Added mobile segmented tab navigation (`[Editor]` / `[Preview]`) and responsive single-row toolbar layout for mobile viewports.
  - Resolved nutrition diagnostics disconnection in the analyzer by merging physical and nutritional warnings into primary compiler warnings — the editor only turns these into squiggles when they carry a real position, so an incomplete-nutrition notice no longer misplaces itself at the top of the file.
  - Markdown and print HTML exports keep their explicit "incomplete data" note next to the affected nutrition figures; the interactive HTML preview conveys the same gap through its coverage badge instead.
  - A scale-target that fails to resolve (e.g. an unconvertible unit) now correctly turns the Playground's status badge and error panel red instead of being undersold as a warning, without marking the file tab as if the recipe itself had a syntax error.
  - The Playground diagnostics console no longer gets stuck filtered on a category that just emptied out (e.g. after fixing the warning it was showing).
  - Resolved silent compilation failures in the Language Server by capturing pipeline exceptions and pushing actionable error notifications to webviews — including when the thrown error carries no message, which previously slipped past the check silently.
  - A compile-time failure (parses fine, but `compile()`/`analyze()` throws) now also surfaces as an editor diagnostic, not only as a webview notification, so it's still visible with the preview panel closed.
  - Added bidirectional webview messaging in the VSCode extension to jump directly to error offsets in the active editor.
  - Localized the Playground diagnostics console's collapse/expand tooltip, previously hardcoded in French regardless of site locale.
