Fixed syntax highlighting (TextMate grammar): a bare `@ingredient`, `#cookware`, or `<@parent` mention with no `{}` of its own would have its highlighted span incorrectly extend all the way to the next unrelated `{...}` on the line (e.g. a later `&reference{}`), coloring everything in between as if it were part of the same name. The name-matching patterns now stop at `@`, `#`, `~`, `^`, and `&`, the same sigils the compiler itself stops at.
