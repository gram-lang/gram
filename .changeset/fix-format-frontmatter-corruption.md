"@gram-lang/cli": patch
---

Fixed `gram format` rewriting values inside the recipe's frontmatter (the `---` metadata block at the top of a `.gram` file). For example, an email address like `Jean@Example.com` in `author:` used to get incorrectly lowercased to `Jean@example.com`. Frontmatter is no longer touched by formatting rules meant for the recipe body. File writes are also now atomic and lock-protected, matching the rest of the CLI.
