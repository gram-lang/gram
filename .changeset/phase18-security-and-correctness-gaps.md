"@gram-lang/cli": patch
---

`gram import <url>` now refuses to fetch addresses that aren't publicly routable (localhost, private networks, link-local/cloud metadata addresses), including on redirects — closing a way for a malicious or compromised page to make the CLI fetch internal network resources. API keys stored via `gram init`/`gram config set` are now actually picked up when running the CLI under Node (previously only worked when run via Bun). `gram db enrich` now clearly reports when nothing was written to disk instead of claiming success; AI-suggested ingredient values that are physically implausible (like an ingredient density far outside any real food) are now rejected instead of being written to your ingredient database.
